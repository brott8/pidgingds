Please visit the project homepage at http://quickpop.org/pidginGDS/ for more information.

This plugin is intended to do exactly as it says. It will enable Google Desktop to index your Pidgin (Formerly known as GAIM) logs. I am aware that this plugin has been created in the past. However, the only one I could find is no longer maintained. So I decided to create my own.

To use, you must log your GAIM messages to HTML (not plain text)! Gaim -> Tools -> Preferences -> Logging. HTML and "Log all instant messages". This application does not log chatrooms at this time.
